Tic-Tac-Toe in Python for the Command Prompt

Basic script I created to learn and try out some features of python. It can take any combination of human and computer players, i.e. 1 human and 1 CPU, 2 humans, or 2 CPUs.

To run, go to the directory the script is in and run it by executing tictactoe.py.

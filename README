Tic-Tac-Toe in Python 2.7 for the Command Prompt

Basic script I created to learn and try out some features of python. It can take any combination of human and computer players, i.e. 1 human and 1 CPU, 2 humans, or 2 CPUs.

To run, go to the directory the script is in and run it by executing tictactoe.py or simply run the script by double clicking on it with python installed.

# the main objectives of the player are (in order of importance):
# 1. stop the other player from winning
# 2. win

# if opponent owns 2 index in a combination AND I don't own the third AND I am not one index from winning AND this is not an initial move i.e. a corner grab, then...
# take that square

# initially, go for the corner squares
	# diagonals optimally - never middle
        # I am being told this is a terrible strategy :/
